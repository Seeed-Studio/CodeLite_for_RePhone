 * FUNCTION
 *    vm_log_fatal
 * DESCRIPTION
 *  Generates a log with fatal level of severity.
 *  This is the most serious error, the result of which is the direct
 *  termination of the program. For example, the application fails
 *  to allocate memory upon program start-up. This will result in the
 *  system being unable to generate the user interface screen and
 *  having to terminate the application.
 * PARAMETERS
 *  format_string : [IN] Format string, same as vm_sprintf, followed by argements for the format string.

 * FUNCTION

 * DESCRIPTION
 *  Generates a log with error level severity.
 *  This indicates that an error has occurred, with the result that
 *  one of the program's functions fails to work,
 *  although the program itself will not terminate because of it.
 *  For example, on an English learning program the human voice
 *  pronunciation feature fails to produce any sound.

 * DESCRIPTION

 *  the situation may restore to normal eventually. For example,
 *  the program may fail to connect to the Internet,
 *  the reason for which may be delinquent phone bills, or bad signal coverage.
 *  After recharging the account or moving the phone to a location with a
